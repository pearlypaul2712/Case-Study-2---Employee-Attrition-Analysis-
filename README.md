## INTRODUCTION
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked your data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

## DATASETS USED AND PROVIDED FOR ANALYSIS :
  - **[/dataset/Beers.csv](/dataset/Beers.csv)** : This dataset was provided by our clients of Craft Beer. This dataset contains the details of all the beers made by Craft breweries in US.  
  - **[/dataset/Breweries.csv](/dataset/Breweries.csv)** : This dataset was provided by our clients of Craft Beer. This dataset contains the details of all the  Craft breweries in US.  
  - **[/dataset/Beers_and_Breweries_merged.csv](/dataset/Beers_and_Breweries_merged.csv)** : As part of the EDA we merged the Beers and Breweries dataset to analyze the beers made in every States
  - **[/dataset/Craft_Beer_Breweries_merged_Cleaned.csv](https://github.com/pearlypaul2712/Craft-Beer-and-Breweries-Study/blob/9f745ddb1af6e570dc19426ac069c2cf8c75039a/dataset/Craft_Beer_Breweries_merged_Cleaned.csv)** : This dataset contains the merged dataset Beer and Breweries .Since the merged dataset contains missing ABV and IBU values. Hence to avoid this bias of missing values to impact our analysis we did replaced the missing values with the respective means of respective regions.
  - **[/dataset/Region_State.csv](/dataset/Region_State.csv)** : As part of our analsysis we created this dataset to group the States by region to come up with valuable insights.
